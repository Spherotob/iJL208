iJL208
======
The metabolic model for the near minimal organism **Mesoplasma florum**.

Significance
------------

Complete knowledge of molecular mecanisms happening within a cell is likely to occur in a cell with a smaller genome. This pursuit, also termed a cellular chassis for synthetic biology, is the ultimate goal of minimal cells study. Given its ~800kb genome and 715 genes reported in Genbank, **M. florum** is poised to become a cellular chassis for synthetic biology. In that sense, this metabolic model gathers all the available knowledge on **M. florum** into a single computational framework.
