    "In this tutorial, we will compare the model predictions to experimental data. The validation of the predictions is an indicator of the reliability of a model. As we should always see things on the bright side, the predictions that were not validated by the model are opportunities to learn new biology, remember that no model is perfect but some are useful. We will compare the following model predictions with experimental data:\n",
